    """
    Triggers the download of the GPT model file by initializing the FunctionNameGPT model with a specific configuration.

    This function sets up a minimal configuration that disables the usage of memory mapping (mmap), CPU threads, and GPU layers
    to trigger the model file download without intending for actual model execution. This setup is useful for pre-downloading the model
    file in environments where direct model execution is not the goal, such as preparing a deployment environment or caching the model
    file in advance. It is recommended not to use this configuration for executing the model in typical application scenarios due to
    the disabled computational resources.

    The `verbose` mode is enabled to provide detailed output during the model download process, offering insights into the download progress
    and any potential issues encountered.
